## Encryption

SecureForms uses industry standard encryption technologies like RSA and AES.

It gives you option to choose out of three encrpytion modes:
- RSA Only (All data is encrypted with RSA, but because of RSA's limits, you can only encrypt up to ~200 charactes)
- RSA+AES (A random AES Key and IV Pair is created at client side, and this keypair is used to encrypt the form response, then this keypair is encrpyted with RSA and sent back to the server encrypted)
- DISABLE ENCRYPTION

## Other Security Features

- All data is encrpyted on the user's browser
- SQL Injections are not possible
- CSRF Validation is used in all forms
- Keys are generated on the server side and not available to anyone

## Form Editor

- Fields collapse when not editing
- Easy drag&drop fields
- Quickly create and setup new fields
- Compatible with all modern browsers
